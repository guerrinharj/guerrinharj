<h1> Gabriel Guerra </h1>

<p>Hi, my name is Gabriel Guerra, Iâ€™m a full stack developer based in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,
mainly working with the Ruby on Rails framework, although I also deal with other roles, such as
maintaining a small devops operation by constantly setting up Docker and the CI pipelines of Git
repositories, and also dealing with the Vue.JS framework for basic front end

    
<p>In my last work at Nobordist, a logistics company, I led the development of the CrossBorder API.
I took the job in early in 2022, and by the time that section of the company was still in baby
steps, so I implemented a rigorous system for handling a high volume of daily HTTP requests
from global carriers like DHL, FedEx, and UPS. I have to deal constantly with clients from the
USA, Europe and mostly of all China as you may know China is. Pretty much the biggest party
when it comes to worldwide logistics.</p>

<p>Apart from business meeting, each week I was in charge of implementing new features -
ensuring they were all test-driven by RSPec and meticulously organized our Git repository. So
that mean working with a different environments and branches and trying to keep our tech team
in sync. Communication had to be held a big standard.
My main philosophy as a developer is a almost like a designer: to create legible and scalable
systems that are mindful to the businessâ€™ goals.</p>

Some of my favourite tools are:
