<h1> Gabriel Guerra </h1>

<p>Iâ€™m a full-stack developer from Rio de Janeiro with over 5 years of experience building web applications that balance creativity with solid engineering.</p>

<p>My main focus is on API development, e-commerce, and crafting test-driven, scalable systems. Iâ€™ve worked across startups, freelance gigs, and personal projectsâ€”everything from streaming platforms to internal tools and dashboards. I enjoy the full journey: planning, coding, debugging, deploying, and refining.</p>

<p>I mostly work with Ruby on Rails, Python/Django, Vue.js, React, and Docker. I'm comfortable jumping between backend logic and frontend design, and I care a lot about code quality, performance, and developer experience. I also spend time setting up CI/CD pipelines and monitoring systems to keep things smooth in production.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m always exploring new tools and ideasâ€”whether it's building something from scratch or improving an existing flow. My goal is to make useful, reliable software that people enjoy using.</p>

<p>
Some of my favourite tools are:
